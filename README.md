# Binary-Facial-Image-Classification-ML
Binary facial image classification using CNNs, MLPs, SVMs, and ensemble methods. Kaggle competition project.

This project implements a binary facial image classification system. Multiple machine learning methods—including CNNs, MLPs, SVMs, and ensemble techniques—are evaluated to optimize classification performance on facial images.

The dataset contains facial images labeled as 'pleasant' or 'unpleasant'. Used for training, validation, and testing of various classifiers.

Methods
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- Shallow and Deep Neural Networks (MLPs)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Logistic Regression
- Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost)
